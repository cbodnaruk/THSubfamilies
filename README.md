# THSubfamilies
Mapping data of the Trans-Himalayan Subfamilies as per Van Driem (2013)
The data consists two main components:

1. A set of GeoJSON file for each of Van Driem's subfamilies, with data pulled from Glottolog and sorted as per Van Driem's (2013) sample lists of languages in each subfamily.
2. GeoPackages showing an approximate area for each subfamily. These polygons are derived from the spread of points in the GeoJSON files, and smoothed for visual appeal. In general, these polygons will be smaller than the actual spoken area as they represent the coverage of the individual points representing each language, rather than the total spoken area of each language.

Sample maps are provided.
